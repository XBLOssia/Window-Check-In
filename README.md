Initial commit. If you don't know what this is, it's not ready yet.

Requires a file to be created called config.js in the /Scripts directory.
It should look like this:

var config = {
    MY_CID : 'xxxxxxxxxxxx',
    API_KEY : 'xxxxxxxxxxxx',
    SHEET_ID : 'xxxxxxxxxxxx',
};

Replace the Xs with your Google API Client ID, your API key, and the ID of the Google Sheet you're planning on using.
